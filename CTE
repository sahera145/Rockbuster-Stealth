Created an SQL Query using a Common Table Expression:

WITH average_cte AS
(
SELECT E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city=C.city,
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
  INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id=E.customer_id
  WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Phillipines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
  AND C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Celaya', 'Nezahualcyotl', 'Atlixco')
  GROUP BY E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
  ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5
)
SELECT AVG(total_spent) AS average_total_spent
FROM average_cte;
