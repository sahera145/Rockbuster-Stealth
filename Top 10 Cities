Joins used to gather top 10 cities:

SELECT C.city AS top10_cities, D.country AS country, COUNT(customer_id) AS sount_of_customer
FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id=B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city=C.city,
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
  WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 'Phillipines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
  GROUP BY C.city, D.country
  ORDER BY count_of_customers DESC
LIMIT 10
